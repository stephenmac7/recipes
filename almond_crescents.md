## Ingredients
- 1 cup soft butter
- 1/2 cup plus 1 Tbsp confectioners' sugar
- 1 egg yolk
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1 tsp almond extract
- 2 cups sifted flour
- 1 cup nuts (usually almonds, but walnuts/peanuts work too)


## Steps
Toast nuts at 350 for up to 20 min. Chop very finely or mill into small pieces.
Cream butter and sugar. Beat well. Add egg yolk and flavorings and beat to blend. Add flour gradually, mixing until moistened. Add nuts and blend. Form into small crescents about 2 1/2 in long and bake on an ungreased cookie sheet in a 350 F oven 20 minutes or until slightly golden. Remove from oven. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
