# Chipa
A Paraguayan cheese bread made with tapioca flour.

## Ingredients
- 40 oz tapioca flour

- 5 sticks butter, softened
- 15-16 oz farmer cheese
- 6 oz mozzarella
- 1.5 tbsp salt
- 1.5 tbsp anise
- Some milk, if necessary

## Steps
Combine eggs and butter. Add cheeses, salt, and anise. Incrementally mix in tapioca flour
(you may need a potato masher or similar instrument). Finish mixing with your hands.
