# Chocolate Mousse
Makes 6-8 servings.

## Ingredients
- 250 g (8 oz) bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped (or chocolate chips)
- 1/4 cup (60 g/2 oz) unsalted butter, cut into 3 pieces
- 3 Tbsp dark rum (Kahlua and Brandy might also work)
- 2 Tbsp water
- 1 tsp espresso powder (optional)
- 4 large eggs, separated, room temp
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 3/4 cup heavy cream
- Pinch of salt
- 1/4 cup (50 g) granulated sugar

## Steps
In the top of a double boiler, combine the chocolate, butter, rum, water, and optional espresso powder. Set over barely simmering water and melt the chocolate and butter. Whisk until the mixture is glossy and smooth. Remove from the heat and add the egg yolks one at a time, whisking well after each addition until blended. Add the vanilla, then continue stirring until the mixture is once again glossy and smooth. Set aside to cool, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula, until lukewarm, about 10 minutes.

In a bowl, using a mixer on medium speed, whip the cream until medium-firm peaks form when the heaters are lifted. Set aside.

Carefully clean the beaters and, in another clean bowl, combine the egg whites and salt. Beat the egg whites on medium-high speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar and continue to beat until glossy, firm peaks form.

Spoon the whipped cream onto the chocolate mixture and, using the rubber spatula, fold it in gently, stopping when large streaks of chocolate are still visible. Add the beaten egg whites and continue folding until the mousse is just blended.

Spoon into individual serving bowls or a single large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to overnight before serving. Garnish with whipped cream, raspberries, or (white) chocolate curls if desired.
