# Custard
English-style custard for topping desserts.

## Ingredients
- 1 to 1 1/2 tbsp Birds custard powder
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 cup low-fat or whole milk
- Pinch of salt
- Vanilla extract, to taste

## Steps
Mix the custard powder into a paste with the salt and sugar and a bit of milk/water till it is smooth while the milk heats in the microwave.  Add enough milk so it easily mixes (somewhat runny).
Microwaves vary but heat roughly 1min 30s per cup of milk. Stir mixture into the warm milk and cook in 1min increments till the custard boils.  Stand nearby or youâ€™ll be cleaning up a messy microwave.
