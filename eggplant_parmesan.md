# Eggplant Parmesan

## Ingredients
- 1-2 Eggplants, cut into rounds or lengthwise
- Tomato Sauce (about 1 jar)
- Mozzarella Cheese
- Parmesan Cheese
- 4-6 eggs
- 2 spoons flour
- Salt
- Oil

With two eggplants, you may need two baking dishes and a second jar of tomato sauce.

## Steps
1. Preheat oven to 450 F
1. Mix eggs and salt. Add flour.
1. Dip eggplant into mixture and fry (placing finished eggplant in paper-towel lined baking dish)
1. Transfer eggplant somewhere else to hold it
1. Cover bottom of baking dish with tomato sauce. If it's too thick, add a little water.
1. Build layers of eggplant, tomato sauce, and mozzarella. On the inner layers, just put about six spoons of tomato sauce in places where eggplant meets.
1. On top of the final layer of eggplant, add enough sauce to cover. Add a little less mozzarella than in the inner layers and add parmesan (enough to cover sauce).
1. Cover with foil
1. Normal cooking: cook on the middle rack about 20 min and then uncover and cook another 10 min, until top browns;
Quick cooking: cook on the bottom rack until it begins to bubble (about 7-10 min), move it to the center rack until cooked through, remove foil, and cook on the top rack to brown
