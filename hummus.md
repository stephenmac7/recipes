# Hummus
TODO: use actual measurements so we don't have to use a single-serving blender.

## Ingredients
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 can garbanzo beans, drained
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp salt (or more, to taste)
- 1/2-1 lemon, depending on size
- Olive oil
- Tahini

## Steps
Add dry ingredients and tahini to single-serving blender, add lemon and olive oil to 2 cm below the garbanzo bean line. Add water to 1 cm above the line. Blend.
