# Pasta Frola
Guava Tart

## Ingredients
- 3 cups flour
- 5 tsp baking powder
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 3/4 cup butter
- 2 eggs (beaten)
- Some milk, if necessary
- 2 cups guava paste, warmed

## Steps
Preheat oven to 350 F. Stir together dry ingredients. Add butter with a pastry
blender or two knives. Mix in eggs. Add enough milk that the dough is no longer
crumbly. Roll out 3/4 of the dough and place into a greased round or rectangular
baking dish. Spread out dough until the bottom of the dish is covered and
slightly climbs up the sides. Cover with guava paste. Roll out the rest of the
dough and cut into strips. Crisscross them across the jelly and if possible,
fold over the sides onto the strips to crimp the edge. Bake for 25 minutes.
