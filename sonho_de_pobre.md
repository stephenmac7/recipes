# Sonho de Pobre
Pretty much a doughnut.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 t(b)sp sugar (not sure)
- 1 egg
- A pinch of salt
- A bit of milk
- Oil (for frying)

## Steps
Mix ingredients except the oil. The dough should be thick but not dry.
If too dry, add extra milk. Drop in oil with a spoon. Try to cook at
medium heat, as it can stay doughy on the inside if cooked at a temperature
that is too high. Coat with powdered sugar or granulated sugar. Alternatively,
eat with guava preserve.
